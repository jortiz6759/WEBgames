<h1>Cut the Rope</h1>
<p>Om Nom is hungry but he can't reach the candy! Feed the adorable little monster with treats hanging from ropes out of his reach. The quicker you feed him, the better your score will be. Think strategically about collecting stars to improve your score. Encounter new challenges as you progress through each level. Play now - this monster needs to eat! </p>
